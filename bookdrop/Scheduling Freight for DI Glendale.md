# Remember
- DI - Glendale can be scheduled via email. Others will be via text.
- When responding to Shannon, draft an email and notify Mark about it.
- Try to schedule the pickup every Tuesday.
	- If Shannon sent us an email onÂ Monday / Tuesday morning, we probably would still schedule it for Tuesday the following week. They are somewhat flexible. It depends on how full our warehouse is of books, and if DI is in a rush to move it. Just draft something and notify Mark.
- Once we have confirmation from Shannon regarding the schedule of pickup, **WE NEED TO UPDATE** `monday.com`.
