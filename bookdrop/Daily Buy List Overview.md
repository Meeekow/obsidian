# Questions
1. Please provide the link for the spreadsheet.
2. Please provide the login credentials for `Amazon Business Prime` account.

# Goal
1. Check if there are any items that are recently added to the spreadsheet that hasn't been bought yet.
	- check if the item is available on `Amazon Business` account
	- check if the item can be shipped
2. Update the following on the spreadsheet:
	- Bought?
	- Arrival Date
	- Other Notes

# Remember
1. It would be best to have a separate Google Chrome profile for the Amazon account for this task.
	- reduce chance of "Seller Account" and "Business Prime Account" getting mixed up when purchasing
