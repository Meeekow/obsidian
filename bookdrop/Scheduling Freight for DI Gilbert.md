# Source
- Our contact person for this is Vee Astill.
- Mark created an iMessage group chat for him, me and Vee(Houston DI Book Pickups).

# Pickup Schedule
- Whenever Vee asks if we can pickup, and if Mark does not respond after 30mins, we need to buy time by sending Vee a message instead. Use this [[#Message|template]] and update it every so often so as not to sound like we are responding with a copy/paste templated message.
- Send Mark a message to see when is a good time to do a pickup.

# Remember
- We need to check with Mark before we schedule pickups for this source along with DI Mesa and DI Glendale.
	- We can pick up anytime we want.
	- We need to consider the schedule such that it will arrive when we are not that busy, understaffed etc.
- Can hold 30+ gaylords at a time.

Hi Vee! Yes, for sure. I will check and get back to you quickly with a specific day and see if it works for you. Thanks!
