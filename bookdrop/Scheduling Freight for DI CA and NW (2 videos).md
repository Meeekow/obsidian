# Remember
1. Eric Anderson is our usual point of contact.
	- we have to respond as soon as we can
	- emails are not always about multi stop pickups
	- sometimes Mark gets a text message from store managers too
2. We usually do our pickups by region as this is more cost effective.
3. Sacramento branch is in between Southern California and Northwest, thus we can include it if the situation permits. Whichever makes sense cost wise.
4. It is usually cheaper to just do pickups for California(excluding Sacramento as this adds a very long drive).
5. TCL, ArcBest are the usual freight brokers we contact for this loads.
6. 44 Gaylord boxes is a good baseline since we can fit at most 48 Gaylord boxes in shipping.
7. Always account delay, load times on each store when considering a pickup date.
8. A good rule of thumb is to avoid first pickup day/date on Friday.
9. If there are multiple stops, we cannot finish picking up everything in a day.
10. Propose a date with Mark and go from there.

# Procedure with Eric
1. Compose a draft so Mark can review.
	- **DO NOT ADD ANY RECIPENT** to avoid sending a message by accident.
	- **MAKE SURE DRAFTED EMAIL IS PROOFED** so we don't look like we are sending a templated email response.
	- 
2. **`READ STEP 1`**.
