# Overview
Mark will handle the communication with the main pickup contact for this source. He will then let me know if we need to schedule a pick up.

**The truck driver would need to get an empty scale ticket prior to pick up and a full scale ticket after pick up**. This source requires this.

It is important that the truck driver **DOES NOT FORGET TO GET THIS BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE PICK UP LOCATION**.

# Template for Loads
1. Go to the spreadsheet link.
2. Locate the correct tab.
3. Only update the cells highlighted in blue.
	- Pickup Date
	- Pickup Time always be set to 8:00am
4. Copy the generated subject, body of text.
5. Copy the recipient from the spreadsheet too.

# Freight Broker
It is important that whichever we use, the rep knows that we need the scale tickets so they can instruct the driver to get this.

# Payment
We would need to send `Angie Harrison` the photos of the scale tickets first. Then she will send us the invoice.

Once an email is drafted, move it to `1a. Drafts to Review` so Mark can proof before sending.
