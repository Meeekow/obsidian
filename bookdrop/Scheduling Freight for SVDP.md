- Our contact person is Vanessa Featherson. She will let us know once they have 26 or more gaylords for us via WhatsApp group chat(SVDP Phoenix Books).
- We have to deliver the check in person on the same day of pickup.
- Whenever Vanessa asks if we can pick up, and if Mark does not respond after 30mins, we need to buy time by sending Vanessa a message instead. Use this [[#Message|template]] and update it every so often so as not to sound like we are responding with a copy/paste templated message.
- Need gaylord swaps every few months.
	- Some would like the pallet / gaylord boxes returned.
	- Some sources will charge us for the pallet / gaylord purchases.

# Pickup
- Before the date of pickup we need to get the check to Rod O so he can bring it on the day of pick up.
	- Ideally, not the same day Rod O will do the pick up since they would need to go out of their way to pick up the check and then drive again to get the load from SVDP.
- Send a chat in WhatsApp group chat and ask them to come and pick up the check.
- Remind Mark so he can write the check.
- Generally pick ups on Monday / Friday are not a good day for loads to arrive.
- Every Friday, we are understaffed, we have our weekly meetings, etc.

Hi Vanessa! Yes, for sure. I will check and get back to you quickly with a specific day and see if it works for you. Thanks!
