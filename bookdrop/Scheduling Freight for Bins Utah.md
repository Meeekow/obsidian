# Overview
Loads are challenging to pick up since the warehouse is in a residential area.

Our driver's name is Dillon. He is also responsible to oversee things whenever there is a scheduled pick up. We would need the truck to be there on time since every moment Dillon spends waiting for the truck is a time wasted.

We only need to pay for the pick up since books are from our bins.
