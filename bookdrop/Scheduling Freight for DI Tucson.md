# Remember
- When filling out forms for freight brokers, we would usually say the weight in pounds to be 44,000 lbs. especially if the number of Gaylord boxes is between 40 and 44.

# Freight Brokers
- Our go to freight brokers:
	- Schneider
	- Uber
- We usually pick whichever is cheaper to save some money.
- Ideal time for freight brokers to pick up our load is 9am.

# Schneider
1. Update the form with the following details:
	- Specify Pick Up Time: 9am
	- Standard Cargo Value set to $4,000
	- Pickup Request Number: BOOKDROP-date when the pick up will happen (i.e. BOOKDROP-0428)
	- Commodity Type: Paper Products
	- Package Type: Pallet
	- Quantity: this will depend on what our point of contact person would say
	- Total Commodity Weight: based on the quantity
		- always overestimate pallet count & weight to prepare carriers and truckers.
	- Master Bill of Lading: BookDrop-date when the order was made
	- Reference: DROP
	- Value: Tucson DI
		- easier for our warehouse guys to know where it is coming from
