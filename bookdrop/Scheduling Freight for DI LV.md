# Remember
1. Eric Anderson is our usual point of contact.
	- we have to respond as soon as we can
	- emails are not always about multi stop pickups
	- sometimes Mark gets a text message from store managers too
2. TCL, ArcBest are the usual freight brokers we contact for these loads.
3. Always account delay, load times on each store when considering a pickup date.
4. A good rule of thumb is to avoid the first pickup day/date on Friday.
5. Propose a date with Mark and go from there.

# Procedure with Freight Brokers
1. Use the `template for loads` to generate a template.
	- follow the instruction on the spreadsheet tab you are using
	- make sure all details are correct
2. Reach out to freight brokers to get a quote.
	- make sure to check and update the recipients

# Procedure with Eric
1. Compose a draft so Mark can review.
	- **DO NOT ADD ANY RECIPENT** to avoid sending a message by accident.
	- **MAKE SURE DRAFTED EMAIL IS PROOFED** so we don't look like we are sending a templated email response.
	- 
2. **`READ STEP 1`**.

# Procedure on Monday.com and BOL
1. Update monday.com, `Logistics` workspaces, under `Inbound Loads`.
2. Update BOL details once the loads are delivered.
