- Our contact person is George. He will let us know once the next load is ready via iMessage group chat(SVDP LA Books).
- They charge our card on file.
- Whenever George asks if we can pick up, and if Mark does not respond after 30mins, we need to buy time by sending George a message instead. Use this [[#Message|template]] and update it every so often so as not to sound like we are responding with a copy/paste templated message.

# Pickup
- Check with Mark regarding this since our go to freight brokers are Uber and Schneider and I'm not sure if we have those available since it wasn't shown on the video.

# Message

Hi George! Yes, for sure. I will check and get back to you quickly with a specific day and see if it works for you. Thanks!
