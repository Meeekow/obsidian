# Overview
We ask them via WhatsApp group chat when we have a load that needs to be picked up. We should update `monday.com` for each pick up that we are trying to get scheduled.

> `monday.com` > `Logistics` > `Inbound Loads` > `Loads to be Reviewed` > `Status`

Set a task on Google Calendar so we can make a follow up on the day of the pick up. We can reach out usually around 9:30am - 10:00am.
