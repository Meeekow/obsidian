# load id
main purpose is for our warehouse tracking / processes
scannable bar code goes into gaylord
scannable bar code base on source id
a bit hard to track the loads
we need to know the quality of the books

**WE NEED TO RESPOND AS FAST AS WE CAN**
may it be text/email

**TRY AND SCHEDULE AND GET QUOTE QUICKLY**

uber, schneider
the more advance we schedule, the more we can save on money(discount)

harder to find trucks if we schedule at a later date


we need to arrive at the pick up window they gave us
important to get there on time


tql arcbest generally better but more expensive
uber schneider cheaper in general

rod o does local pick ups for us; good relationship

do not reach out for the main pick up contacts for now
need to go through Mark for the time being

**once we have access on template for loads**:
**add a row and add a drop off id: source**
**change the load id > pickup id/load id**
**chop off the long video according to the source they are addressing**
**rename and attach link to process library**

challenging to load gaylords since warehouse is in residential area
go with jmaze@tql if price difference is within $150 usd
if cheaper with collin, we go with them

deliver check in person on same day of pickup
before the date of pickup we need to get the check to rod o so he can bring it on the day of pick up
chat in whatsapp group chat so can ask him to come and pick up the check
remind mark so he can write the check
Monday/Friday pick up is generally not a good day for loads to arrive
on Friday, we are understaffed, weekly meetings
most loads if cannot come in same day would arrive on Monday which will then means we will be very  busy
